            Since late 2020, when
            <a [routerLink]="routerLinkAbout">Ghostfolio</a> took shape, the
            main goal has remained the same: to simplify investment tracking
            while prioritizing user privacy and enable investors to make
            informed decisions. Our journey so far has been incredible, with
            over 300 releases since the
            <a href="../en/blog/2021/07/hello-ghostfolio">first major release</a
            >, close to 300’000 pulls on Docker Hub, and collaboration with 50+
            contributors from around the globe. Ghostfolio was recently featured
            on
            <a
              href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37337482"
              target="_blank"
              >Hacker News</a
            >, where it ranked on the front page and briefly hit the #1 spot.
            Shortly after, the project’s repository was trending on GitHub.
            These achievements emphasize the growing recognition for our project
            and the path we are on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we are thrilled to present Ghostfolio 2.0, another milestone in
            our journey to empower investors.
