            We are happy to announce that
            <a href="https://ghostfol.io">Ghostfolio</a>, the web-based personal
            finance management software, is now available in the
            <a href="https://umbrel.com" target="_blank">Umbrel</a> App Store, a
            home server OS for self-hosting.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of individuals
            and organizations moving their data to the cloud. While cloud
            computing has its benefits, such as accessibility and scalability,
            it also comes with some concerns regarding data privacy and
            security. However, there is an alternative to cloud computing that
            provides the convenience of the cloud while giving you ownership and
            control of your data: personal servers.

              >Umbrel</a
            >
            is an operating system based on
            <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> that
            allows you to run a personal server in your home. With it, you can
            self-host open source apps directly from an integrated app store.
            This means that you can discover self-hosted apps directly in the
            <a href="https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps" target="_blank"
              >Umbrel App Store</a
            >
            and install them in one click. You can get up and running Umbrel on
            a Raspberry Pi 4, any Ubuntu / Debian system, or a VPS in only 5
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Umbrel offers numerous advantages for running a personal server in
            your home, such as enhanced data privacy and security, ownership and
            control of your data, and access to a diverse selection of
            self-hosted apps.
