            As <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com">Hacktoberfest</a> has come to
            an end, it’s time to look back and share our learnings.
            Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software
            (OSS) projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of
            contributors. Each October, open source maintainers from all over
            the world give extra attention to new contributors while guiding
            them through their first pull requests on
            <a href="https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio">GitHub</a>. This
            year the event celebrated its 10th anniversary. At Ghostfolio, we
            have participated in the event for the
            <a href="../en/blog/2023/09/hacktoberfest-2023">second time</a> this
            year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this debriefing, we’ll take a closer look at our journey during
            Hacktoberfest, exploring the facts and figures, key takeaways, and
            the impact on Ghostfolio.

            application for managing personal finances. The software aggregates

            Our experience at Ghostfolio during Hacktoberfest 2023 has been
            truly remarkable. Despite the absence of T-shirt rewards this year,
            our expectations were exceeded in every way.

          <h2 class="h4">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <p>
            We’ve gathered some valuable takeaways from our experience to
            consider for upcoming years. These insights can help us and fellow
            open source projects make the most of Hacktoberfest:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <h3 class="h5">Prepare early</h3>
              <p>
                Prospective contributors often begin looking for tasks as early
                as the end of September. Preparing your project, organizing
                issues, and setting clear goals in advance can help you attract
                and engage more participants.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h5">Meet formal requirements</h3>
              <p>
                Ensure that your project aligns with Hacktoberfest’s formal
                requirements and rules. Properly tag issues, provide clear
                guidelines for contributions, and make sure your project is
                accessible to newcomers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h5">Allocate sufficient time</h3>
              <p>
                Being responsive and providing support to participants is
                crucial. Allocate enough time to answer questions, review and
                merge pull requests, and offer guidance to first-time
                contributors. This level of support can significantly enhance
                the experience for both contributors and maintainers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h5">Provide clarity in descriptions</h3>
              <p>
                When creating issues for Hacktoberfest, be as clear as possible
                in your descriptions. Including screenshots, links to code
                examples, and detailed instructions can make it easier for
                contributors to understand and complete the task successfully.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h5">Isolate tasks</h3>
              <p>
                Ideally, focus on tasks that are approachable for beginners, as
                the setup and frameworks used can already be quite challenging.
                This way, you can attract a wider range of contributors.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h5">Embrace learning</h3>
              <p>
                Understand that not every attempt will result in a successful
                contribution. It’s okay if a contributor’s pull request doesn’t
                make it into the project. Encourage a learning mindset and
                provide constructive feedback, helping contributors grow and
                improve over time.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By following these takeaways, we can ensure a rewarding experience
            for everyone taking part in future Hacktoberfest events.
