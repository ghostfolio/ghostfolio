            In this article I would like to introduce my new open source project
            in more detail: <a href="https://ghostfol.io">Ghostfolio</a>, a
            web-based personal finance management software.

          <h2 class="h4">What problem does Ghostfolio solve?</h2>
          <p>
            Due to rising inflation and negative interest rates, I have been
            looking for some time at how I can invest my assets in the most
            diversified way possible. Specifically, I follow a
            <a [routerLink]="['/resources']">buy and hold strategy</a> with
            investments in different asset classes spread across different
            platforms. Therefore, I was looking for an app that would
            holistically aggregate my portfolio. During my research on the
            internet and in app stores, I have tried several solutions, but none
            of them has convinced me completely: too complicated, too cluttered,
            not optimized for smartphones or not comprehensive enough.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h4">The vision</h2>
          <p>
            It is particularly important to me that I get an overview of all my
            assets in real time. Previously, I only had the prepared figures
            available once a year, when I had completed my annual tax
            declaration. In addition to the cash balance in the savings account,
            the overall picture also includes country-specific traits such as
            the voluntary pension plan (pillar 3a) in Switzerland.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, I have talked to many colleagues who have been
            investing for a longer time. Quite a few have created complex
            spreadsheets from the same considerations. I think that should be
            better in 2021.

            Ghostfolio is supposed to be a simple wealth management software. It
            presents the current assets at any time and supports the decision
            making of future investments. Whether rebalancing the portfolio in
            asset classes (stocks, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, etc.) or financing an
            apartment, Ghostfolio offers solid, data-driven decision support.

            As I value privacy, data protection is an integral part of
            Ghostfolio. As

            greedy eyes of big banks or big tech.

          <h2 class="h4">From idea to implementation</h2>
          <p>
            With this background I have started the ambitious project and
            programmed with small steps a software that I could quickly use for
            myself. As a stack, I chose modern web technologies that are
            personally of particular interest or that I would like to learn and
            deepen. These include <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>,
            <a href="https://nx.dev">Nx</a> for the management of the monorepo,
            <a href="https://nestjs.com">NestJS</a> for the backend and
            <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> as a database.
            The code of the frontend and backend is written in
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I have shortly reached my limits with some calculations, I
            have looked into different possibilities to get valuable support.
            Hoping that other people could also benefit from the solution and
            contribute with improvements if interested, I have released the
            existing code as open source software. Very soon, other
            <a
              href="https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio/graphs/contributors"
              >developers</a
            >
            contributed to Ghostfolio with great enhancements.
