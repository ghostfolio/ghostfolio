            Before you can think of
            <a [routerLink]="['/resources']">long-term investing</a>, you have
            to get your finances in order. Take a look at Peter's journey to see
            how you can achieve it, too.
          </p>

            Peter enjoys life, but sometimes he overspends a bit. He realizes it
            when money runs out already in the middle of the month. Then the
            next few days become difficult and saving money is out of the
            question. That is why he wants to plan his monthly budget in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peter has a decent salary in his job. But as soon as the salary
            arrives in his account, it melts away. In order to find out where
            his money is disappearing, he has decided to plan his monthly
            budget. He wants to be able to put money aside for major expenses
            and set financial goals.

          <h2 class="h4">Keeping a traditional or digital budget book</h2>
          <p>
            First, Peter obtains an overview of his personal finances. To do so,
            he starts keeping a budget book. This can be done on paper by
            listing his income and expenses for a few months, or he can create a
            simple spreadsheet in Excel. In addition, many credit card providers
            offer the feature within their apps of having expenses automatically
            analyzed according to different categories. According to the
            <a href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home.html"
              >Swiss Federal Statistical Office</a
            >, households in Switzerland spend around 20 percent of their
            disposable income on housing and around 10 percent on groceries.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the smartphone app, Peter has a better overview of his
            financial affairs. The application assigns the bookings to
            individual categories. Peter can assign specific budgets to each of
            them. This way, he is always informed about how much money he can
            still spend on restaurant visits in the current month, for example.
            A traditional method is the so-called
            <a
              href="https://www.investopedia.com/envelope-budgeting-system-5208026"
              >envelope method</a
            >. One envelope is labeled for each category like groceries, rent or
            student loans. The monthly budget is put into the envelopes in cash.
            Many apps offer the same budgeting system in a more convenient,
            virtual way.

          <h2 class="h4">Planning and investing</h2>
          <p>
            If Peter has spent less money than planned on eating out at
            restaurants, he can set aside the remaining amount. This way, he can
            treat himself to something special every now and then. From now on,
            he saves a fixed amount of money in a separate account (“pay
            yourself first”) by standing order at the beginning of the month. As
            soon as there are three net monthly salaries in the account, he
            invests the monthly savings amount in a passively managed global
            equity fund. This grows his assets over the years and allows him to
            supplement his pension later.

          <h2 class="h4">How to achieve your financial goals?</h2>
          <p>
            If you follow these five actionable tips, you can reach your
            financial goals easier and faster. Start with one tip and when you
            implement it well, you can try the next one to ultimately have more
            money at the end of the month.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h5">1. Visualize your goals</h3>
          <p>
            Start visualizing your goals. For example, hang up pictures of the
            travel destination you are saving for. Imagine that you have already
            achieved the goal to slowly adapt your mindset.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h5">2. Write off personal items</h3>
          <p>
            Do as a business does and write off purchases annually. For a new
            car, you could set aside one-sixth of the purchase price each year.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h5">3. Save at the beginning of the month</h3>
          <p>
            Have a savings amount deducted from your account at the beginning of
            the month. Then you will pay yourself first and spend less money.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h5">4. Follow the 50-30-20 rule</h3>
          <p>
            You need 50 percent of your disposable income for fixed costs. 30
            percent can be spent on personal needs such as hobbies, travel or
            consumer electronics. 20 percent is left for savings or to pay off
            potential debts.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h5">5. Track your progress</h3>
          <p>
            If you have any money to spare, invest it in a broadly diversified,
            low-cost portfolio excluding the risks of individual stocks. Track
            the progress of your portfolio and net worth with
            <a href="https://ghostfol.io">Ghostfolio</a>, a web-based personal
            finance management software.
